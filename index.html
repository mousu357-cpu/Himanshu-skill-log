  <section id="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my Employability Skills Log. This webpage demonstrates how I developed essential employability skills during my academic projects, particularly the RainyDay Café operational improvement project. The evidence provided highlights my growth in teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="teamwork">
    <h2>Teamwork</h2>
    <p>Through the RainyDay Café project, I worked in a simulated project team with roles such as café manager, business analyst, and operations specialist. This experience helped me learn how to collaborate effectively, share responsibilities, and adapt to different perspectives. Good teamwork allowed us to stay on track and achieve our project goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screenshot of project team roles (from report)</li>
      <li>Extract of RACI matrix</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="communication">
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>I developed my communication skills by preparing and delivering a professional presentation on the RainyDay Café project. I learned how to simplify complex ideas, such as workflow redesign and supplier optimisation, and explain them clearly to an audience. This gave me more confidence in presenting and sharing information.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Presentation slides</li>
      <li>Notes/feedback from practice sessions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="problem-solving">
    <h2>Problem-Solving</h2>
    <p>In this project, I analysed issues like long wait times and poor inventory management. By applying SMART objectives, Gantt charts, and a budget plan, I learned how to approach problems with structured and realistic solutions. This experience strengthened my ability to think critically and apply theory to practice.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gantt chart from project report</li>
      <li>SMART objectives section</li>
      <li>Budget breakdown</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Working on the RainyDay Café project has been a valuable experience that allowed me to build and reflect on my employability skills. When I first started, I was not fully confident about applying theoretical knowledge to a practical case. However, going through the process step by step helped me realise how much I could actually contribute.</p>
    <p>One of the main skills I developed was teamwork. Collaborating with others made me more aware of how important it is to listen, share ideas, and adapt when someone else has a better approach. I also improved my communication skills by presenting complex ideas more clearly and confidently. Finally, I strengthened my problem-solving skills by addressing operational issues and creating realistic solutions.</p>
    <p>Overall, this project helped me discover both my strengths and areas for improvement. I feel more prepared to apply these skills in my studies and future career.</p>
